# HackPred
Given the dataset, we are to build a model to predict future cyber hack.
Problem Stament: To build a predictive model to identify patterns in the given variables that suggest that a hack is going to happen.
Data: The train and test data will consist of the various features that will help to predict if a hack is going to happen or not.
 The variables present are:
    "* INCIDENT_ID: Unique identifier for incident log,
    "* DATE: Date wof occurence,
    "* X_1- X_15: Anonymized logging partners
 The parameter to be predicted:
   MULTIPLE_OFFENSE: Indicates if the incident was a hack(1: Yes, 0: No)
