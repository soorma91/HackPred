# HackPred
Given the dataset, we are to build a model to predict future cyber hack.

Problem Stament: To build a predictive model to identify patterns in the given variables that suggest that a hack is going to happen.

Data: The train and test data will consist of the various features that will help to predict if a hack is going to happen or not.

The variables present are:\n
    * INCIDENT_ID: Unique identifier for incident log\n,
    * DATE: Date wof occurence\n,
    * X_1- X_15: Anonymized logging partners
 
 The parameter to be predicted:\n
   MULTIPLE_OFFENSE: Indicates if the incident was a hack(1: Yes, 0: No)
